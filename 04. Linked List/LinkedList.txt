What ?

Linked List is a Linear data structure.
It is a collection of nodes.
Node is collection of data and pointer.

Why ?

arr[10] - now unable to change size of arr at runtime
vec<int> v(5); - now to increase size vector double itself and copy all values
            but it is not optimal because it takes extra space to copy values.

That's why we use Linked List
Linked List - Dtnamic data structure
            - grow and shrink at runtime ( no memory wastage )

        Linked List vs Array/vector
Insertion    O(1)         O(n)
Searching    O(n)         O(1)

Types of Linked List
- Singly LL
- Doubly LL
- Circular LL
