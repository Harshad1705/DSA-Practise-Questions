when a function calls directly or indirectly to itself is called Recursion.

It is used when solution of complex problem depends on the solution of same type of small problem.

If we don't write base case : then error is : "SEGMENTATION FAULT".

Tail Recursion : where recursion performed after preocessing.
Head recursion : where recursion performed before processing.
