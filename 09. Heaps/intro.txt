Heap is a complete binary tree that comes with a Heap order property.

complete binary tree :  every level is completely filled except last level.
                     : nodes always added from the left or lean towards the left.

Heap order property - minOrder property & maxOrder Property

two types of Heap : 
   Max Heap        Min Heap
     50               10
    /  \             /  \
   30  40           20   30
  /  \             /  \
 10   20          40   50 


In 1 based indexing - 

Node         = I th  index
left child   = 2*I th   index
right child  = 2*I + 1 th   index

parent = I/2 th index

complete binary tree - leaf index = (n/2 + 1 ) to n


In 0 based indexing - 

Node         = I th  index
left child   = 2*I + 1 th   index
right child  = 2*I + 2 th   index

parent = I/2 - 1 th index

complete binary tree - leaf index = n/2 to n -1
