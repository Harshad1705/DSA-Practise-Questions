Tree - non-linear data structure in which one node is connected with multiple node.

Node of tree:
Node{
    int data;
    list<Node> child;
}

Basic terms -- 
1. node     
2. root             top most node of tree . example - 1
3. children         nodes which are connected to that node , exmaple : children of 3 - 6
4. parent           example: parent of 4 : 2
5. siblings         nodes having same parent . example : 4 and 5 are sibling
6. ancestor         example: ancestor of 4 are - 2,1
7. descendent       example: descendent of 2 are - 4
8. leaf             nodes having no children , example : 4,5,6

    4       5           6

Binary tree : tree having maximum two children.

Node of binary tree:
Node {
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;
}
